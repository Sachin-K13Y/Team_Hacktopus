# MargDarshan Hub - Simple Project Guide

## What is MargDarshan Hub?
MargDarshan Hub is a friendly online platform to help college students get ready for job placements. It’s a safe place where students can:
- Share their placement experiences (like how interviews went).
- Ask and answer doubts with others, staying anonymous.
- Track their progress with rankings.
It’s made just for your college, and it’s free to use!
- Through our website we are trying to build a community of students in our college
- We have also included the stats of college students codeforces account to encourage competitive environment

## Why We Made It
We built MargDarshan Hub because we saw our friends struggling with placements. Here’s why:
- Many find it hard to talk to seniors for help.
- There’s no easy, private way to share doubts or questions.
- Students don’t know what to expect when companies visit because they can’t get quick tips.
- There’s no fun competition to practice coding and get better.
We wanted to make things easier and more fun for everyone!
## How We Decided to Build It
Here’s how we came up with the idea:
- We watched our batchmates and listened to their problems.
- We noticed they needed a private space, quick tips, and a way to compete.
- We asked some friends if they’d use a platform like this, and they said yes!
- We planned simple features like a doubt-sharing area and a ranking system.
- We started building it step by step, using easy tools, and now we have a working version by April 2025.

## What We’ve Done So Far
We’ve made good progress by now (April 12, 2025):
- Created a basic website where users can log in.
- Added a Experience page to share placement stories.
- Made a doubt forum where people can help each other.
- Built a profile page to see rankings.
- Around 70% completed
